## 06:00 - 12:00: Drilling 12-1/4" Section
- **Status**: Drilling ahead (正常钻进) from 3250m to 3310m.
- **Parameters**: 
  - WOB (Weight on Bit): 15-18 kips
  - RPM: 120 (Surface) + 150 (Motor)
  - ROP (Rate of Penetration): Avg 12 m/hr. 
  - Torque: 18 kft-lbs (Fluctuating due to stringers).
- **Mud Properties**: 
  - MW (Mud Weight): 1.45 SG
  - Viscosity: 65 sec
  - Chlorides: 25,000 mg/L

## 12:00 - 14:00: MWD Failure
- Incident: Lost pulse signal from MWD tool. 
- Troubleshooting: Cycled pumps 3 times. No signal.
- Decision: POOH (Pull Out Of Hole) for inspection. Suspect pulser jam due to LCM (Lost Circulation Material).

## 14:00 - 18:00: Tripping Out
- Operations: POOH to shoe @ 1500m. 
- Observations: Tight spots at 2800m. Max overpull 30 kips. Backreamed 2 stands.

## Notes / 交接班事项
- ⚠️ 注意: The formation change at 3300m (Sand/Shale sequence) caused severe vibration. Stick-slip level high.
- Inventory: Barite stock low (< 20 tons). Need resupply ASAP from base.
