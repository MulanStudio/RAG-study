## 3. Key Technical Terminologies (核心技术术语)

| English Term | Chinese Term | Definition / Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Drilling Rig** | **钻机** | The machine used to create holes in the earth's sub-surface. Can be onshore (land rigs) or offshore (jack-ups, semi-submersibles). |
| **Drilling Fluid / Mud** | **钻井液 / 泥浆** | A fluid used to cool the drill bit, carry rock cuttings to the surface, and maintain well pressure to prevent blowouts. |
| **Wireline Logging** | **电缆测井** | Lowering measurement tools into the well on an electrical cable to read rock properties (gamma ray, resistivity, porosity). Essential for finding oil. |
| **Hydraulic Fracturing** | **水力压裂** | Injecting fluid at high pressure to break rocks and release trapped oil/gas. Crucial for Shale Oil (页岩油) extraction. |
| **Coiled Tubing** | **连续油管** | A continuous length of metal pipe wound on a spool, used for well interventions without stopping production. |
| **Christmas Tree** | **采油树** | An assembly of valves, spools, and fittings used to regulate the flow of pipes in an oil well (not a plant!). |
